Feel free to update this README as you progress through the sessions and customize it to reflect the details of your project. For more details on the elements required for a reproducibility package, refer to our [README template](https://github.com/worldbank/wb-reproducible-research-repository/blob/main/resources/README_Template.md), which you will cover in the **Reproducibility Package** session.

Remember this is what you will share with your peer at the end of the training for review.
